PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough over West Germany’s cash offer to
help America’s balance of payments position. He said bluntly in Washington yesterday that the offer - 357million - was not good enough. And he indicated that his
Government would try to get Germany to pay more. He did not mention personal

Though they may gather some Left-wing support, a large majority of Labour M Ps
are likely to turn down the Foot-Griffiths resolution. Mr. Foot’s line will be that as
Labour M Ps opposed the Government Bill which brought life peers into existence,
they should not now put forward nominees. He believes that the House of Lords
should be abolished and that Labour should not take any steps which would appear
to *prop up” an out-dated institution.
